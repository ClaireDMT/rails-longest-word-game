Le Wagon Bootcamp Challenge on Week 6, first day on Ruby On Rails.

Background & Objectives:

Time to implement a "Longest-word game" with a cool web-interface! For some of you, it will seem familiar.

Before jumping into the exercise, read the rules: https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-challenges/tree/master/01-Ruby/06-Parsing/02-Numbers-and-Letters

Specs

Let's think about the UI for our game. What do we need?

    A page to display the game settings (random letters), with a form for the user to type a word. A button to submit this form.
    A page receiving this form, computing the user score and displaying it.
